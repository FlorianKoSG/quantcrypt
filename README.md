# QuantCrypt

A collection of post-quantum cryptographic algorithms (and emerging standards) implemented in Rust.

## Composite ML-KEM for Use in the Internet X.509 Public Key Infrastructure and CMS

A set of [Key Encapsulation Mechanism](https://lamps-wg.github.io/draft-composite-kem/draft-ietf-lamps-pq-composite-kem.html) (KEM) schemes that use pairs of cryptographic elements such as public keys and cipher texts to combine their security properties. These schemes effectively mitigate risks associated with the adoption of post-quantum cryptography and are fully compatible with existing X.509, PKIX, and CMS data structures and protocols.
